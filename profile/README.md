# Python + Ansys = PyAnsys

Welcome to the PyAnsys project.

The PyAnsys project is a collection of Python packages that enable the use of
Ansys products through Python.

## Contacting Us

Much effort is underway to continue expanding and developing repositories in the
[PyAnsys GitHub](https://github.com/pyansys/) account. On the ``Issues`` page
for each package, you can post issues and request new features. You can also feel free
to post a question on the [Ansys Developer Forums](https://discuss.ansys.com/).

## Contributing to PyAnsys

We are excited to have you on board.

If you would like to contribute to the PyAnsys project, see the
[PyAnsys Developer's Guide](https://github.com/pyansys/dev-guide). You can
obtain the latest PDF of this guide from the [PyAnsys Developer's Guide - Releases](https://github.com/pyansys/dev-guide/releases).

Feel free to contact us by opening a discussion or an issue in the respective PyAnsys GitHub repository.

If you're external to Ansys but want to contribute to our repositories, please open an issue on the appropriate repository and we'll consider adding you as an external contributor on a per-repository basis. This will give you write permission to open pull requests without forking the repository. You can always fork a repository and push pull requests from the fork instead if you prefer.
