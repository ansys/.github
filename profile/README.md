# Python + Ansys = PyAnsys

Welcome to the PyAnsys project.

The PyAnsys project is a collection of Python packages that enable the use of
Ansys products through Python.

This project originated as a single package, `pyansys`, and has
expanded to several main packages:

* [PyAEDT](https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to AEDT
* [PyDPF-Core](https://dpf.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to DPF (Data Processing Framework) for building more advanced and customized workflows
* [PyDPF-Post](https://post.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to DPF's postproccessing toolbox for maninuplating and transforming simulation data
* [PyMAPDL](https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to MAPDL
* [PyMAPDL Reader](https://reader.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to read legacy MAPDL result files (MAPDL 14.5 and later)
* [PyFluent](https://fluent.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to Ansys Fluent
* [PyFluent-Parametric](https://fluentparametric.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to Ansys Fluent parametric workflows
* [PyFluent-Visualization](https://fluentvisualization.docs.pyansys.com): Pythonic interface to visualize Ansys Fluent simulations using Python
* [PyPIM](https://pypim.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to communicate with the PIM (Product Instance Management) API
* [Granta MI BoM Analytics](https://grantami.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to Granta MI BoM Analytics services
* [Shared Components](https://shared.docs.pyansys.com/): Shared software components to enable package interoperability and minimize maintenance

Much effort is underway to continue expanding and developing packages in the
[PyAnsys Github](https://github.com/pyansys/) account. On the ``Issues`` page
for each package , you can post issues and request new features. You can also email
questions to [PyAnsys Support](mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>).
