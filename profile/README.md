# Python + Ansys = PyAnsys

Welcome to the PyAnsys Project!

The PyAnsys project is a collection of Python packages to enable the
usage of Ansys products through Python.

This project originally began as a single package, `pyansys`, and
has been expanded to six main packages:

* [PyMAPDL](https://mapdldocs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to MAPDL
* [PyAEDT](https://aedtdocs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to AEDT
* [PyDPF-Core](https://dpfdocs.pyansys.com/): Post-Processing using the Data Processing Framework (DPF).  More complex yet and more powerful post-processing APIs.
* [PyDPF-Post](https://postdocs.pyansys.com/): Streamlined and simplified DPF Post Processing.  Higher level package and uses ``ansys-dpf-core``.
* [Legacy PyMAPDL Reader](https://readerdocs.pyansys.com/): Legacy result file reader.  Supports result files from MAPDL v14.5 to the current release.
* [Granta MI BoM Analytics](https://grantami.docs.pyansys.com/): Pythonic interface to Granta MI BoM Analytics Services.

This is an expanding and developing project.  Feel free to post issues
on the various GitHub pages in this document.  For additional support,
contact the [PyAnsys Support](mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>) 
and your requests will be routed correctly.
